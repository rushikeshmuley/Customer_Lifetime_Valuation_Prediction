#  Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction Project

# Introduction

In today's data-driven business landscape, understanding and predicting customer behavior is of paramount importance. One key metric that assists businesses in assessing customer value and making informed decisions is Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). CLTV represents the total revenue a business can expect from a customer throughout their entire relationship.

For this project, we explore the calculation of CLTV using a retail dataset. The dataset contains information about customer transactions, including recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM). These three RFM components serve as the foundation for predicting the CLTV of each customer. Here's a brief overview of the dataset:

a. Recency (R): This metric measures how recently a customer made a purchase. It is typically defined as the time elapsed since the customer's last purchase.

b. Frequency (F): Frequency represents the number of purchases made by a customer within a specified time period. It reflects customer engagement and loyalty.

c. Monetary (M): Monetary value signifies the total amount of money spent by a customer on purchases. It provides insights into the customer's spending habits.


# Roadmap


Our goal in this project is to utilize these RFM metrics to predict CLTV. To achieve this, we follow these steps:

Calculate the average order value for each customer by dividing monetary value by frequency.

Compute the total purchase frequency, which represents the collective purchasing behavior of all customers.

Determine the purchase frequency per customer, revealing the average number of transactions a typical customer makes.

Analyze the repeat rate, indicating the percentage of customers who make more than one purchase.

Calculate the churn rate, which represents the rate at which customers stop making purchases.

Introduce a profit margin assumption (e.g., 20%) to calculate the profit margin for each customer.

Finally, estimate the CLTV for each customer using the formula: avg_order_value * purchase_frequency / churn_rate.

# Model Selection

To predict CLTV, various approaches can be considered, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and customer segmentation techniques. The choice of model depends on the specific goals and characteristics of the dataset. In this project, we have opted for a straightforward calculation-based approach rather than a predictive model, as the goal is to estimate CLTV based on existing transaction data.


# Conclusion:
  
  In this project, we leveraged RFM analysis and related metrics to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for a retail dataset. By breaking down the analysis into several steps, we were able to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and, subsequently, their potential lifetime value to the business.

Key findings and insights from the project include:

a. The average order value, representing the monetary value per transaction, ranged widely among customers.

b. The repeat rate indicated that a significant proportion of customers made multiple purchases, contributing positively to CLTV.

c. The churn rate, representing customer attrition, was calculated, highlighting the importance of retaining existing customers.

d. The estimated CLTV for each customer provides valuable information for decision-making, particularly in tailoring marketing strategies, identifying high-value customers, and optimizing resources.

Overall, this project demonstrates how RFM analysis and CLTV estimation can be valuable tools for businesses seeking to understand and maximize the value of their customer base. These insights can inform strategies for customer retention, segmentation, and targeted marketing efforts, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the business.
